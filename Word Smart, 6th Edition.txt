A word often confused with adverse is averse:: (uh VURS). The two are related but they don’t mean quite the same thing. A person who is averse to doing something is a person who doesn’t want to do it. To be averse to something is to be opposed to doing it—to have an aversion to doing it.

An allusion is an allusion only if the source isn’t identified directly. Anything else is a reference or a quotation.

ANARCHY:: (AN ur kee) n absence of government or control; lawlessness; disorder

Antecedent is related to a word that is similar in meaning: precedent.

APOCRYPHAL:: (uh POK ruh ful) n of dubious authenticity; fictitious; spurious
• Brandi’s blog discredited the apocryphal report of Martians in Congress.
An apocryphal story is one whose truth is not proven or whose falsehood is strongly suspected. Like apocalypse, this word has a religious origin. The Apocrypha are a number of “extra” books of the Old Testament that Protestants and Jews don’t include in their Bibles because they don’t think they’re authentic.

• Nick appropriated my lunch; he grabbed it out of my hands and ate it. So I appropriated Ed’s.

Don’t confuse the pronunciation of the verb to appropriate with the pronunciation of the adjective appropriate:: (uh PROH pree it).
